# Portfolio V3
This is Portfolio V3, and was built using REACT.


In this portfolio you will find:

* Consistant navigation whether on desktop or mobile.

* Responsive page elements and images that adapt well to varying screen sizes.

* Zero use of media queries.

* Functioning and responsive card columns on the portfolio page.

* Links that work.

* Semantic HTML.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

* Functional, deployed application

* Bootstrap components, ie containers on all pages, a grid system using columns and rows on the About page(index.html,
  while utilizing Boostrap's Card Columns system on the portfolio.html page.
  
*A sticky footer was made using the class="fixed-bottom" borrowed from Bootstrap navbar settings.
